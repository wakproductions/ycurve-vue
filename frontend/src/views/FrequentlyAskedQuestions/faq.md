## What is the purpose of this app?

This is a technical project that allows easier analysis of historical US Treasuries interest rates. Yield curve inversions
have in the past been a reliable indicator of impending economic recessions, and this app allows you retroactively
explore the yield curve shape on various dates.

## Where is the data compiled from?

The data on this website is a compilation of figures from various publicly available sources. Treasury yield curve data
from 1990 to present is collected from the Treasury Department website and represent market rates at the end of day. 
Older data sets are obtained from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Data repository. Some of the treasury rates 
are based on secondary market rates, and others are estimated based on constant maturity.

# Compiling for Production (Local Step)

This application is to be deployed and run from the `ycurve-backend` folder. The front end files for production are
to be built from the script `build-vue.sh`, which when run will build the front end and put it in the 
`./ycurve-backend/public` folder, to be served as a static SPA.

# Running this app anywhere

docker-compose up web
